# Transfer-Learning-Experiment-in-CNNs
This repository contains the implementation and experiments for Assignment 1 in image classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning. The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of transfer learning by comparing training strategies using the Cats vs Dogs dataset and the Stanford Dogs dataset.
